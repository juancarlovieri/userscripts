# How to install the userscripts?

Get tampermonkey if you don't already have it installed:  https://tampermonkey.net

Open the raw .js link directly or through github UI, e.g. navigate to https://github.com/wimglenn/userscripts/blob/master/stackoverflow.com/social-notworking.user.js and click the "Raw" button, or go directly to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wimglenn/userscripts/master/stackoverflow.com/social-notworking.user.js

A tampermonkey dialog should appear for you to import/install the script.
